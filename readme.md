# Data Analysis and Visualization of iphone

This repository contains code for data analysis and visualization using Python's `matplotlib.pyplot` and other librarys. The code demonstrates different visualizations and analysis techniques applied to iPhone data.

## File Descriptions

- `apple.ipynb`: This file demonstrates how to create a scatter plot using `matplotlib.pyplot`. It shows the relationship between the number of ratings, discount percentage, and sale price of iPhones.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:


2. Install the necessary dependencies. Ensure that you have `matplotlib` and `numpy` libraries installed:


3. Run the `apple.ipynb` file using a Python interpreter. This will generate the scatter plot visualizing the relationship between the number of ratings, discount percentage, and sale price of iPhones.

## Results

The scatter plot generated by the code illustrates the relationship between the number of ratings and discount percentage of iPhones. The size of the data points represents the corresponding sale price. Additionally, a trendline is added to visualize the trend between the variables.
